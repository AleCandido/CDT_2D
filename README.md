# CDT_2D
My own implementation of CDT in 1+1 dimension

## TODO

- ~~Write the moves~~
- ~~ Write python script for graphical elaboration ~~
    - ~~ and maybe include in the script simulation launching and results collecting ~~
- New observables
    - Insert save methods for simulation results
- Simulation stop

### Simulation
This is the real missing thing: DEBUG

Idea: sometimes in the plots appear slice of spatial volume 2. It should not happen. Moreover they never appear with spatial volume 1, maybe these attempts are the cause of errors.

### Python
The only things really remain to do is:

- find new observables for new plots
- manage condition for simulation stop

the rest is:

- find meaningful names for objects in the script
- find meaningful name for THE script
- write docs and docstrings
