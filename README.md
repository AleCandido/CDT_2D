# CDT_2D
My own implementation of CDT in 1+1 dimension

## TODO
The steps to implement are the following:

- triangulation saving format
- fundamental move selection
- path saving

### Triangulation
For the triangulation saving format I have to write the following classes

- Label
- Vertex
- Triangle
- Triangulation
- Simplex

### Fundamental move
I have to choose the best (good enough) extraction procedure and compute probabilities.
